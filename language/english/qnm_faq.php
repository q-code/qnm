<b>A brief introduction</b><br/>
<div style="margin:20px 15px">
<a id="I1"></a><b>What is a network element?</b><br/>
An element is a device or equipment included in the network. Note that a element can also be a group of equipments like a station, a rack... 
By definition an element can contain sub-elements.<br/>
<br/>
<a id="I2"></a><b>What is a network connector?</b><br/>
The connector allows linking elements together.
Note that connectors are always inside an element and that they cannot have sub-elements.
It is not mandatory to define all connectors inside the elements to be able to build the network. 
QNM allows you defining the relations between the equipments without going to the level of the connectors.<br/>
<br/>
<a id="I3"></a><b>What is a network line?</b><br/>
A line is an element (cable, route, pipe) that can contain double connectors : one on each side of the line.
During the creation of connectors on a line, QNM will propose to create automatically the corresponding connectors (called mirrors) at the end of the line.
A line (e.g. a cable) allows linking equipments together. It is possible, but not mandatory, to describe the relations at the level of the connectors (inside the equipments and at both ends of the line).<br/>
<br/>
<a id="I4"></a><b>Network management</b><br/>
QNM allows managing the network (elements, connectors, lines and their relations). 
Note that QNM focus on a collaborative management of these elements. 
They can be documented (pictures, technical fiches...) and QNM allows managing the notes (observations) issued by the users.<br/>

<a id="L1"></a><b>Why registering?</b><br/>
You may not have to. It is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order to view, search or post notes. It only takes a few minutes to register so it is recommended you do so.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="L2"></a><b>How registering?</b><br/>
In the registration page you will find the usage policy. Read it carefully. If you agree with the terms and conditions, you can choose your username. Depending on the registration security defined by the Administrator you will have to directly choose your password and confirm it, OR enter your e-mail address (a temporary password will be send to you).
You will also have to copy a code displayed in the form.
If the username you choose is already used by a board member, you will have to choose an other username.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="L3"></a><b>Can I hide my E-mail?</b><br/>
In your profile you will find a privacy option allowing you to hide your e-mail for unregistered visitors or for even for users. Note that staff members will nevertheless will be able to see hidden e-mails.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="L4"></a><b>Lost password!</b><br/>
Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. Go to the login page and click Forgotten password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="L5"></a><b>I registered in the past but cannot log in anymore!</b><br/>
The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not use the application? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who did not use the system. Try registering again and get involved in the application.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="L6"></a><b>Why can't I log in?</b><br/>
Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="S1"></a><b>How do I change my profile?</b><br/>
Your profile (if you are registered) is stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (or on your username in any list page). This will allow you to change all your information.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="S2"></a><b>How do I show an image with my username?</b><br/>
There may be one image below a username when viewing posts. This image is sometime an avatar. It is up to the board administrator to enable user's picture. If you are unable to add your photo (or avatar) from the Profile page, it's because the administrator decide it, certainly for good reasons.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="S3"></a><b>How do I change my rank?</b><br/>
You cannot change the wording of any rank (ranks appear next to your username in the memberlist and bellow your name in the message pages). This board use ranks to identify certain roles. For example, staff members and administrators have special roles. It's up to an administrator to promote a member to the staff rank. A staff member has the right to close/re-open a element, to move a element to the correct section, and to modify the content. An administrator can also perform these actions (and much more). 
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="S4"></a><b>I cannot click the e-mail of a user</b><br/>
Sorry, but users can prevent unregistered users (or event members) from seeing their e-mail. In this situation, you will not be able to see the e-mail in the user's profile page nor from the memberlist page.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="P1"></a><b>Why can't I access the sections?</b><br/>
The board administrator can decide to limit the access for unregistered users. In this case, only registered users will be granted to see the sections, the elements and the notes. In other cases, unregistered users can see the sections and the elements list, but are not allowed to see or issue notes. It's the same for the search tool or the userlist. It's up to the board administrator to decide which part of the board is accessible for visitors.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="P2"></a><b>Which sections are accessible to me?</b><br/>
The board support two kind of sections: the public sections and the hidden sections. Hidden section are visible only by the staff members, while public sections are accessible to the users. It's up to the Administrator to decide if the public section can be visible also by visitors or not. Note that a section can be closed. This means that it is still accessible, but elements and notes cannot be changed (except by the staff members).
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="P3"></a><b>How do I post a note about an element in a section?</b><br/>
Easy. Open the element and click the relevant button (add note) in this page. You may need to register before you can add a note.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="P4"></a><b>How do I edit or delete a note?</b><br/>
Unless you are the a staff member you can only edit or delete your own notes. You can edit a note by clicking the edit button for the relevant note.
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="U1"></a><b>What are Staff members?</b><br/>
Staff members are people assigned the highest level of control over the data. 
These people can edit or delete elements and notes, activate/inactivate, move, or delete elements in all sections. 
<br/>
<a href="#top" class="small">Back to top</a><br/><br/>

<a id="U2"></a><b>What are Administrators?</b><br/>
Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. 
These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, creating staff members, controlling the board security, style, etc. 
They also have full capabilities of the staff members, in all sections.
<br/>

<a id="U3"></a><b>What is a Section coordinator?</b><br/>
A section coordinator is a staff member whose job is to look after the running of a section from day to day. Like the staff members, he has the power to edit or delete elements and notes, activate/inactivate, move, or delete elements in the section he is responsible for. Generally coordinators are there to help users.
